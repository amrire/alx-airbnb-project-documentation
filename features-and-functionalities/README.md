# 🏡 Airbnb Clone Backend

## 🎯 Project Objective

The Airbnb Clone backend is designed to replicate the core functionalities of a rental marketplace platform like Airbnb. This system handles user authentication, property management, bookings, secure payments, and more. It is built to be scalable, secure, and maintainable using modern backend technologies.

## 📚 Overview

This backend application serves as the backbone of the Airbnb Clone. It provides RESTful APIs, database operations, and integrations that allow frontend clients to manage users, listings, bookings, payments, and more.

## 🔑 Core Functionalities

### 1. User Management
- **Registration & Login**: Secure authentication using JWT, with support for OAuth providers (Google, Facebook).
- **Roles**: Users can register as **guests**, **hosts**, or **admins**.
- **Profile Management**: Update personal info, profile photos, contact preferences.

### 2. Property Listings

- **Update/Delete Listings**: Listings can be modified or removed by their owners.
- **Photo Uploads**: Supports uploading and storing property images.

### 3. Search & Filtering
- Search by location, price range, guest capacity, and amenities.
- Pagination for efficient result handling and UI performance.

### 4. Booking System
- **Create Bookings**: Guests can book available properties for selected dates.
- **Date Validation**: Prevents double-bookings and overlaps.
- **Cancel Bookings**: Role-based cancellation features.
- **Status Tracking**: Status values include: `pending`, `confirmed`, `canceled`, `completed`.
